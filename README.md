# cyber-security-threat-prediction-using-ML
This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict cybersecurity threats using historical network traffic data from the CICIDS2017 dataset. Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes models are implemented to detect attacks such as DDoS, PortScan, and brute-force attempts with improved accuracy and interpretability.
